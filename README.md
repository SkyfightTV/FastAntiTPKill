# FastAntiAFK
    What is FastAntiAFK ?

FastAntiAFK is a plugin that allows you to detect AFK players on your server and execute one or more commands like "/kick %player%". It is designed to consume the least amount of resources on your server. It starts the check as soon as it starts (compatible with /reload).

    How does it work ?

After placing it in the "plugins" folder of your server and restarting it. The plugin will automatically create a config.yml file in your home folder.
After configuring it and restarting or reloading, the plugin will immediately start detecting AFK players within the time you specified in the config.yml file.
Now you can avoid lags on your server and make room for more active players to connect!

I hope this plugin will be useful for you !

I am open to any request for modification of the plugin but also to contributions that can be made by you!
