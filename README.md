    What is FastAntiTPKill ?

FastAntiTPKill is a plugin that allows you to remove TP kills on your server and avoid receiving a mass of messages for it. When teleporting, the player is protected for a certain time and is deleted if he hits an opponent.

    How does it work ?

After placing it in the "plugins" folder of your server and restarting it. The plugin will automatically create a config.yml file in your home folder.
